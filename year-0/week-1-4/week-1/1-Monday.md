# Monday: Establishing a Routine

## Learning Objective:
Establish a consistent daily routine to provide a sense of security.

In the initial stages of Sam's learning plan, it is crucial to create a structured and predictable environment. A consistent routine not only offers a sense of security for children with Autism but also aids in building foundational skills necessary for future learning experiences.

## Morning Activity
**Activity 1: Morning Routine Introduction - Greet the day with a familiar sequence of activities.**

This activity focuses on the importance of starting the day with a structured routine. By introducing a set sequence of morning activities, such as a welcome song, basic hygiene practices, and a brief social interaction, Sam can gradually become familiar with the expectations associated with the morning routine. This not only assists in developing a sense of predictability but also helps in cultivating essential skills like personal care and social engagement.

## Afternoon Activity
**Activity 2: Late Afternoon Routine Introduction - Establish the afternoon being tied to the morning with familiar activities from the morning.**

To further reinforce the sense of routine and consistency, the late afternoon session mirrors the morning routine. By incorporating elements from the morning, such as revisiting a familiar song or engaging in a shared activity, the afternoon session becomes an extension of the established routine. This helps Sam in understanding the cyclical nature of daily activities, fostering a sense of order and predictability.
